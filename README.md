# Flock JavaScript Problem Set

## Problem 1:
Utilizing Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I built a simple To Do List application. I used simple input forms to capture it's field values and injected that data into the table. If I had more time, I would add validations to the form to ensure all fields are present before submission of the item. I initially implemented these functionalities using jQuery until I was advised to show off my JavaScript. :) You can view the jQuery execution here: https://github.com/katherinebui/Flock-JS/blob/master/problem-1-jQuery

To see the To Do List application:

Assuming you are at the root of the directory:
```
cd problem-1
```
```
open index.html
```

## Problem 2:
When provided with two different jQuery function calls, I was asked to describe a scenario on when and why I would use each. My answers are provided here: https://github.com/katherinebui/Flock-JS/blob/master/problem-2.md


# Problem 3:
I used JavsScript to make a simple calculator with add, subtract, multiple and divide functionalities. Utilizing ES6 introduction to classes in JavaScript, I have provided a way to execute basic math operations on numbers.

To run the examples provided (assuming you are at the root of the directory):
```
cd problem-3
```
```
node calculator.js
```
