# Flock JavaScript Problem Set

## Problem 1:
Utilizing Bootstrap, JQuery, HTML, and CSS, I built a simple To Do List application. I used simple input forms to capture it's field values and injected that data into the table. If I had more time, I would add validations to the form to ensure all fields are present before submission of the item.

To see the To Do List application:

Assuming you are at root
```
cd problem-1
```
```
open index.html
```
